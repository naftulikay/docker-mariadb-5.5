docker-vagrant-playground
=========================

A [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) project to allow easy experimentation with [Docker](http://docker.io) containers in Ubuntu 12.04.

To get started, you'll obviously need Vagrant and VirtualBox. Apart from that, simply run:

    $ vagrant up

to start and provision the Ubuntu 12.04 server instance. Then, to connect, run:

    $ vagrant ssh

and voil√†! You're now in a virtualized Ubuntu 12.04 instance complete with the latest version of Docker!
